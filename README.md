# Firebase Comments Section Demo

The `main` branch of this repo has a basic YouTube clone setup, minus a comments section.
The `complete` branch has a completed firebase comments section implementation.

## Getting started

### Main branch and Complete branch

1. `npm install`
2. Add a file called `./env` with the following code:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your api key goes here>
   ```

### Complete branch only

3. In `src/firebase.js` replace the empty firebase config object with your own.
